# Azure IoT Edge codelab
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Objective
The objective of this exercise is to bringup an Azure IoT Edge solution on a new Azure account. We will use a combination of Azure portal, commandline & Visual Studio Code. 

## Preparing the Cloud 
Duration: 5

### Pre-requisites
- Ensure you have subscription to Azure and are able to access resources via portal.azure.com
- For performing shell operations, you can either use <code>az cli</code> extension or use <code>shell.azure.com</code>

### Initial setup (typical one time for a given project)
- As a good practice, we want to create a new resource group. A resource group allows to group different Azure resources together belonging to the same solution or deployment.

## Preparing the device
Duration: 5

We can look at 2 options:
- Use a Virtual Machine (VM) as a gateway. This is a good for development & testing/automation purpose.
- Use a physical device like a raspberry PI

### Using a VM
In this exercise, we will create a new VM instance and use it for our development. Please follow either of the Azure portal or scripts approach to get the IoT edge device prepared.

#### DIY using Azure Portal

#### DIY using scripts
#### One click deploy (advanced): Suitable for testing/automation
